# SolidWorks CSWA Practice

This repository contains 3D part models I created as part of my preparation for the Certified SolidWorks Associate (CSWA) exam.

The models represent various challenges I worked through, focusing on core SolidWorks concepts such as:

- Sketching
- Extrusions
- Revolves
- Fillet/Chamfer
- Feature patterning
- Sweeps and Lofting

These exercises have helped me master the skills necessary to pass the CSWA exam and are a testament to the knowledge gained throughout my SolidWorks learning journey.
